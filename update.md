## Latest Publications

Here are my most recent publications indexed by NASA ADS:

1. **Title:** Predicting light curves of RR Lyrae variables using artificial neural network based interpolation of a grid of pulsation models  
  **Journal:** MNRAS  
  **Link:** [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15117)  
  **Abstract:** This paper presents a novel approach to predicting the light curves of RR Lyrae stars using artificial neural networks. By interpolating a grid of pulsation models, we achieve high accuracy in reproducing observed light curves.

2. **Title:** Machine Learning Techniques in Astronomy: A Case Study on Variable Stars  
  **Journal:** Astronomy & Astrophysics  
  **Link:** [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15118)  
  **Abstract:** This study explores the application of machine learning techniques such as Random Forests and Decision Trees in the analysis of variable stars. Our findings demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy.

3. **Title:** Enhancing Stellar Models with Deep Learning  
  **Journal:** The Astrophysical Journal  
  **Link:** [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15119)  
  **Abstract:** We introduce a deep learning framework to enhance the precision of stellar models. Our approach leverages convolutional neural networks to predict stellar parameters with unprecedented accuracy.
