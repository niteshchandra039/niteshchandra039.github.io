## Latest Update

Greetings everyone!

Please visit the [Homepage](index.md) for an overview of my research and projects.

To learn more about me, please visit the [About](about.md) section.

One of my recent projects focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to study the behavior of variable stars, particularly RR Lyrae stars. By leveraging the power of Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Decision Trees, I aim to enhance our understanding of these fascinating stellar objects.

I'm excited to announce that my research findings have been published in a prestigious astronomy journal (MNRAS). The paper titled "Predicting light curves of RR Lyrae variables using artificial neural network based interpolation of a grid of pulsation models" is now available online. You can access it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15117).

I would like to express my gratitude to my research team, collaborators, and the University of Delhi for their support and guidance throughout this project.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you would like to discuss collaborations. You can connect with me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/astro_nitesh) or through email at [niteshchandra039@gmail.com].

Thank you for your interest and support!

Best regards,
Nitesh Kumar
