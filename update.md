## Latest Publications

Here are my most recent publications indexed by NASA ADS:

1. **Title:** Predicting light curves of RR Lyrae variables using artificial neural network based interpolation of a grid of pulsation models  
  **Journal:** MNRAS  
  **Link:** [Read more](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad937)  
  **Abstract:** This paper presents a novel approach to predicting the light curves of RR Lyrae stars using artificial neural networks. By interpolating a grid of pulsation models, we achieve high accuracy in reproducing observed light curves.

2. **Title:** Multiwavelength photometric study of RR lyrae variables in the globular cluster NGC 5272 (Messier 3)  
  **Journal:** MNRAS
  **Link:** [Read more](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae1334)  
  **Abstract:** We present a comprehensive study of RR Lyrae variables in the globular cluster NGC 5272 using multiwavelength photometry. Our analysis reveals new insights into the pulsation properties of these stars.
