## Teaching Experience

As a **Senior Research Fellow** at the University of Delhi, I have had the opportunity to mentor and teach undergraduate and postgraduate students. My teaching areas include:

### Courses Taught:
- **Python Programming**: Introducing students to Python, with a focus on programming logic, data structures, and its application in scientific research.
- **Machine Learning in Astronomy**: Covering algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Decision Trees with hands-on coding assignments.
- **Astrophysics**: Focused on stellar physics, variable stars, and cosmological models.

### Mentorship:
- Supervised several undergraduate and master's students on their thesis projects involving machine learning applications in astronomy.
