## Welcome to Nitesh Kumar's Research Homepage

I am a **Senior Research Fellow** at the Department of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi. My expertise lies in the **application of machine learning in astronomy**, particularly focusing on **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**, **Random Forests**, and **Decision Trees**.

### Research Focus
My current research revolves around **variable stars**, especially **RR Lyrae stars**. I leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze their behavior and predict light curves.

For more details, you can refer to my [CV](../Nitesh_CV.pdf) or explore my notable project on **light curve generation** for RR Lyrae stars:  
**[ANN Interpolator for RRab Star Light Curves](http://ann-interpolator.web.app/)**

To learn more about my background and research interests, visit the [About](about.md) section.

Stay updated with my latest work and publications through the [Updates](update.md) section.
