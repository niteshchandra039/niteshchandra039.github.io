## Welcome to Nitesh Kumar's Research Homepage

I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Department of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi, specializing in machine learning applications in astronomy. My research focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Decision Trees, for various astronomical studies. Currently, I am working with variable stars, specifically RR Lyrae stars.

Please take a look at my [CV](../Nitesh_CV.pdf) for more details about my background and research experience.

One of my notable projects involves using machine learning techniques to generate light curves of RR Lyrae stars. You can access the website for generating and downloading these light curves here: [ANN Interpolator for RRab Star Light Curves](http://ann-interpolator.web.app/).
