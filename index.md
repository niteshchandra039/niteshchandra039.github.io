## Welcome to My Research Page

I am Assistant Professor (Astrophysics) at the **Department of Physics, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), Deharadun**. I was Senior Research Fellow at the **Department of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi**, specializing in **machine learning applications in astronomy**. My research focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forests, and Decision Trees, for astronomical studies. Currently, I am working on **RR Lyrae variable stars**.

### Current Research

One of my notable projects involves using machine learning techniques to generate light curves of RR Lyrae stars. You can explore the project here:

- [ANN Interpolator for RRab Star Light Curves](http://ann-interpolator.web.app/)
- [Multiwavelength photometric study of RR Lyrae variables in the globular cluster NGC 5272 (Messier 3)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/3/2976/7681976)

### Research Interests

My research interests include:

- Machine Learning Applications in Astronomy
- Variable Stars (RR Lyrae, Cepheids)
- Stellar Evolution and Pulsation
- Time Series Analysis
- Data Mining and Feature Engineering
