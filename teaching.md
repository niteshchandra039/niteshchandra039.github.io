## Teaching Experience

At UPES Dehradun, I have had the opportunity to teach a diverse range of courses to undergraduate and postgraduate students. My teaching areas include:

### Courses Taught:
- **Python Programming**: Introducing students to Python, with a focus on programming logic, data structures, and its application in scientific research.
- **Fortran Programming**: Teaching the basics of Fortran programming and its applications in numerical simulations.
- **C++ Programming**: Covering object-oriented programming concepts in C++ and its applications in scientific computing.
- **Latex**: Teaching students how to write scientific documents using Latex.
- **Compuational Physics**: Introducing students to numerical methods and their applications in physics.
- **Machine Learning in Astronomy**: Covering algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Decision Trees with hands-on coding assignments.
- **Astrophysics**: Focused on stellar physics, variable stars, and cosmological models.
- **Astronomy Lab**: Practical sessions on observational techniques, data analysis, and astronomical simulations.
- **Planetary Science**: Exploring the solar system, exoplanets, and planetary formation.
- **General Physics Labs**: Hands-on experiments in mechanics, optics, and electromagnetism.

### Mentorship:
- Supervised several undergraduate and master's students on their thesis projects involving machine learning applications in astronomy.


As a **Senior Research Fellow** at the University of Delhi, I have had the opportunity to mentor and teach undergraduate and postgraduate students.
