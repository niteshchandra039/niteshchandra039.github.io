My research focuses on applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze astronomical datasets. I have a particular interest in studying variable stars, such as RR Lyrae stars, and their behavior. By developing innovative algorithms and models, I aim to extract valuable information from these celestial objects, enabling a deeper understanding of their intrinsic properties and evolution.

Throughout my academic journey, I have collaborated with esteemed astronomers and researchers, and I have actively contributed to the field through scientific publications and conference presentations. I have also been involved in organizing workshops and seminars, aiming to disseminate knowledge and foster collaboration among fellow researchers.

I hold a Senior Research Fellow position at the Department of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi. My academic journey has equipped me with a diverse skill set, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm development, and statistical analysis. I continually strive to expand my knowledge and stay at the forefront of emerging trends in both machine learning and astrophysics.
