<p>
I am <strong>Dr. Nitesh Kumar</strong>, Assistant Professor of Astrophysics at the <strong>University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), Dehradun</strong>.
My research focuses on applying <strong>machine learning techniques to astronomical data</strong>, with a particular interest in <strong>variable stars</strong> such as RR Lyrae and Cepheids.
</p>

<p>
I hold a Ph.D. in Physics from the <strong>University of Delhi</strong>, where I worked extensively on stellar variability and time-series modeling using artificial neural networks and statistical classifiers.
My work integrates data-driven methodologies with classical astrophysical theory to uncover patterns in large-scale surveys like Gaia and Pan-STARRS.
</p>

<p>
I am passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration, open science, and mentoring students in computational and observational astrophysics. If youâ€™re interested in working together or just want to connect over astronomy and machine learning, feel free to reach out.
