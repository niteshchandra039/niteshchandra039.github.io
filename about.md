My research focuses on applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze astronomical datasets. I have a particular interest in studying variable stars, such as RR Lyrae stars, and their behavior. By developing innovative algorithms and models, I aim to extract valuable information from these celestial objects, enabling a deeper understanding of their intrinsic properties and evolution.

Throughout my academic journey, I have collaborated with esteemed astronomers and researchers, and I have actively contributed to the field through scientific publications and conference presentations. I have also been involved in organizing workshops and seminars, aiming to disseminate knowledge and foster collaboration among fellow researchers.

Beyond my research, I am enthusiastic about promoting science outreach and education. I believe in the power of scientific communication to inspire and engage people from all walks of life. I actively participate in public talks, science festivals, and social media platforms to share the wonders of astronomy and the possibilities of machine learning in unlocking its secrets.
