## Welcome to My Research Page

I am a Senior Research Fellow at the **Department of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi**, specializing in **machine learning applications in astronomy**. My research focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forests, and Decision Trees, for astronomical studies. Currently, I am working on **RR Lyrae variable stars**.

### Current Research

One of my notable projects involves using machine learning techniques to generate light curves of RR Lyrae stars. You can explore the project here:

- [ANN Interpolator for RRab Star Light Curves](http://ann-interpolator.web.app/)

For more information about my research, you can check my [CV](../Nitesh_CV.pdf).
